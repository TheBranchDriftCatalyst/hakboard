# Innercircle Branch Divergence Plan

## TLDR

I have had an outstanding task to refactor and fix my innercircle-challenge-dashboard project.  This has to deal with saving and editing dashboards as profiles.  This was a perfect oppurtunity for me to take my innercircle-challenge project, simplify it and reimplement a more robust localstorage and
persistence layers.  So I added a fairly heavy focus to this layer.

### InnerCircle Task Breakdown

- [100] draggable grid layout (in-progress)
  - TopBar
    - [100%] Add Box +
    - [100%] Clear
    - [100%] resize
    - [100%] drag
    - [100%] save/load profiles
- [100%] github deployment actions workflow (easy- last thing)
- [95%] localstorage persistence (doneish)
  - [95%] clean this up a bit, change to ephemeral persistence strategy
- [ ] cleanup theme (is a little dark right now)
- Other stuff
  - [ ] database persistence (stretch goal)
  - [ ] docker file (stretch)

# Part 2 Reintegration

- [ ] back integrate innercircle branch refactors and feature additions
